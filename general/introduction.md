# Gatechain: One Chain, Infinite PoSsibilities

Gatechain is a high-performance public blockchain designed to meet diverse application needs, dedicated to providing efficient, secure, and cost-effective blockchain infrastructure for a broad user base and various decentralized applications. 
GateChain is an EVM compatible Layer1 blockchain, utilizing GateMint to realize instant finality.

## Core Features

### EVM Compatible
"EVM" is a newly added GateChain module that supports smart contracts, enabling projects to build and deploy their products on GateChain~opening its doors to the miraculous world of decentralized finance.

With EVM as the smart engine for “GateChain” , we are now accessing the most active community in the crypto space and a full range of eco-products built on "Ethereum" network. "Ethereum" network has incubated a myriad of premium projects over the past few years, some of them even exploring the very frontier for the whole industry. With all those innovations made possible on top of the EVM, compatible to EVM has been one of the basic capabilities for most mainnets.



### Gatemint

Based on universal PoS, GateChain has made more optimizations to make it easier for users to participate in network consensus and achieve asset gain and decentralized management. Different from most PoS economic models, GateChain focuses on the inclusiveness of asset returns, allowing more users to easily participate in consensus and obtain reasonable benefits while protecting the safe and stable operation of GateChain.

### Revocable Transaction

A transaction initiated from a Vault Account is a revocable transaction, allowing assets to be transfered to the “Retrieval Account” instead of the original address. After the revocable period, transaction can not be revoked.Revocable Transaction
