# **DAO-Driven Decentralized Governance**

- **Role of Governance Token (GT)**:  
  GT token holders' voting power is proportional to their holdings, and the system supports delegated voting, allowing users to delegate their voting rights to professional representatives to improve decision-making efficiency.

## **Consensus Nodes and Network Maintenance**
- **Node Election Mechanism**:  
  GateChain adopts a **Tendermint**-based consensus framework, combined with **Algorand's VRF (Verifiable Random Function) algorithm** to optimize node election process, ensuring high security and decentralization. The mainnet supports hundreds of consensus nodes, which must stake GT tokens to participate in block generation and validation.
- **Node Incentive Mechanism**:  
  Consensus nodes earn rewards through block generation rewards and transaction fee sharing, while being responsible for maintaining network security. Malicious behavior will result in staked token slashing.

## **GT Deflationary Mechanism**
- **GT Deflationary Mechanism**:  
  GT token maintains deflation through transaction fee burning mechanism (partial fees from each transaction are destroyed) and periodic buyback-and-burn, enhancing token value and governance participation incentives.

## **Security and Risk Control**
- **Revocable Transaction Model (RTM)**:  
  To address governance attacks or operational errors, GateChain supports revocable transaction logic, allowing the reversal of abnormal proposals or malicious operations within a certain timeframe.
- **Multi-signature and Auditing**:  
  Critical governance operations require multi-signature wallet execution, with regular third-party security audits of code and fund flows to ensure transparency and attack resistance.
