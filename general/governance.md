# 1. **DAO-Driven Decentralized Governance**
- **On-Chain Proposals and Voting**:  
  GateChain implements decentralized governance through **GateChain DAO**, where token holders can submit proposals and participate in on-chain voting to decide on protocol upgrades, fund allocation, and other key matters. Proposal types include technical improvements, ecosystem fund usage, and node management.
- **Role of Governance Token (GT)**:  
  GT token holders' voting power is proportional to their holdings, and the system supports delegated voting, allowing users to delegate their voting rights to professional representatives to improve decision-making efficiency.

## 2. **Consensus Nodes and Network Maintenance**
- **Node Election Mechanism**:  
  GateChain adopts a **Tendermint**-based consensus framework, combined with **Algorand's VRF (Verifiable Random Function) algorithm** to optimize node election process, ensuring high security and decentralization. Currently, the mainnet supports approximately 160 consensus nodes, which must stake GT tokens to participate in block generation and validation.
- **Node Incentive Mechanism**:  
  Consensus nodes earn rewards through block generation rewards and transaction fee sharing, while being responsible for maintaining network security. Malicious behavior will result in staked token slashing.

## 3. **Proposal and Upgrade Process**
- **Proposal Phase**:  
  Any GT holder can submit governance proposals, requiring a certain amount of GT as proposal deposit to prevent abuse. Proposals must include technical details, budget requirements, and implementation roadmap.
- **Voting and Execution**:  
  Proposals are decided through on-chain voting, supporting various voting modes. Once approved, technical proposals undergo multi-signature verification and testnet deployment before final mainnet upgrade by nodes.

## 4. **Economic Model and Governance Incentives**
- **GT Deflationary Mechanism**:  
  GT token maintains deflation through transaction fee burning mechanism (partial fees from each transaction are destroyed) and periodic buyback-and-burn, enhancing token value and governance participation incentives.
- **Ecosystem Fund Allocation**:  
  GateChain establishes development funds and ecosystem incubators, with portions of on-chain revenue (such as cross-chain fees) supporting developer rewards, security audits, and community project incubation. Fund usage requires DAO voting approval.

## 5. **Security and Risk Control**
- **Revocable Transaction Model (RTM)**:  
  To address governance attacks or operational errors, GateChain supports revocable transaction logic, allowing the reversal of abnormal proposals or malicious operations within a certain timeframe.
- **Multi-signature and Auditing**:  
  Critical governance operations require multi-signature wallet execution, with regular third-party security audits of code and fund flows to ensure transparency and attack resistance.
