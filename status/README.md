## GateChain Mainnet Upgrade  v1.1.7 (2025-08-11)

### Overview

1. GateChain consensus version will be upgraded to `v1.1.7`. All nodes participating in the consensus need to upgrade their node binary.

2. Scheduled Upgrade Date: 2025-08-18

3. For detailed information, please refer to the [GateChain Documentation](https://www.gatechain.io/docs/en/developers/gatechain-build/)

### Upgrade Mechanism

The GateChain consensus upgrade process works as follows:

- When a consensus node uses the new binary version for block assembly, it triggers a network-wide upgrade vote
- Once the vote count exceeds the threshold after a round of block creation, the new protocol consensus takes effect network-wide
- At this point, any consensus nodes that haven't upgraded to the latest version will be unable to participate in consensus

### Changelog

1. GateChain consensus version upgrade
   - Update blockchain version number to V17

2.Adds transaction gas fee checkpoints：
   - STD transaction gas fee must be greater than basefee
   - Adds GasRemaining to GasMeter for querying remaining gas 

3.For EVM transactions：
   - Set  initial nounce  of the EVM account to zero
   - Apply a flat 21000 gas for EVM transfer by default

4.For block production mechanism：
   - Introduces gasFeeThreshold mechanism to avoid staking rewards cheating using insignificant staking transactions

5.RPC interface improvements：
   - Introduces LRU cache mechanism at the API layer to provide improved access efficiency
   - Adds new RPC interfaces

6.Other fixes and improvements：
   - Fixes indefinite node waiting issue caused by gas exhaustion
   - Fixes concurrent map read panic 
   - Fixes  precision issues for values returned by RPC interfaces
