# GateSwap Liquidity Protocol Guide

## Overview

GateSwap is an automated liquidity protocol where each GateSwap smart contract (or pair contract) manages a liquidity pool made up of reserves of two ERC20 tokens.

Anyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in exchange for pool tokens. These tokens track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time.
